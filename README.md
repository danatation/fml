Exactly what it says on the tin.

To download the mod, click on Code and then Download ZIP. Maybe rename it to .pk3 while you're at it.

The mod features 3 cvars:

fml_enabled (true)

fml_auto_disable (true)

fml_reset_pitch (false)


fml_enabled enables it

fml_auto_disable automatically disables the mod when you turn on mouselook

fml_reset_pitch resets your pitch to 0 rather then using your pitch before firing
